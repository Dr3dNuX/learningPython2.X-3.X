# learningPython2.X-3.X
This will be the repo where i upload all my learning scripts and example files that i write while going though the book im learning python from

The scripts i get from the book wil have this commented at the top of the script #[+]--[+] else i wrote everything else myself

some of these are also ideas ive come up with while reading and just smashed them out real fast and saved them
